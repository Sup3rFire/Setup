Also, don't make a request for a bot account without properly thinking it through first. Don't waste staff time please!

**You will be banned from the game if you don't follow the rules. It's not my fault if that happens.**

# Setup
The bot to load and save room setups!
Currently WIP as I've been busy coding other stuff
